    <p><em>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game that is made and developed by Valve.</em> The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients which was a mod for Warcraft III.
    Dota 2 is a played in matches of two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own seperate base on the map. Each player controls 1 hero on the map that has
    unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heros to sucessfully defeat the opposing team's heroes. A team wins 
    by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base. For more information check out <a href="https://www.dota2.com/home" target="_blank" style="color:aliceblue"> Dota 2 Homepage </a> ! </p>

    <h3> Positions in Dota 2: </h3>

        <li> Hard Carry </li>
        <dd> The Hard Carry recieves the highest farm priority on the team. This position is most found with the Hard Support. The Hard Carry is to surive the early game wile securing as much farm as possible.
             This is the position that will ultimately win you the game.</dd>

        <li> Mid Laner </li>
        <dd> Mid-laner is the one who solo lanes, and will hit their level 6 the fastest.
             The mid-lane player should help whichever of the other 2 lanes seems to be going dangerously bad.
              Apart from that, mid-laners usually are able to amplify their farms and get early kills on the side lanes.</dd>

        <li> Offlaner </li>
        <dd>The Off-Laner has one of the most important roles in the game. 
            The objective is to harass the enemy carry player and deny him as much farm as possible. 
            Another important part of the off-lane role is to take towers early and expand the map for your team.</dd>

        <li> Roaming Support </li>
        <dd>The job of the Roaming Support is the provide vision on the map, make rotations to other lanes and attempt kills. 
            The roaming support is the one who usually turns up to contest the 4-minute or 6-minute power rune against the mid-laner.</dd>

        <li> Hard Support </li>
        <dd>The job of the Hard Support is to secure the carry heroes game against the off-laner and roaming support. 
            If the opposing team is overextending, the hard support must quickly initiate on them and repel them fast, or your safe lane hero’s life might be in peril.</dd>

    <p><em>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle area (MOBA) video game that is made and developed by Riot Games.</em> Riot developers used DOTA 1 the mod for Warcraft III to develop their
    own stand-alone game. In this game two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the players controls a character, known as a champion with unique abilities
    and differing play styles. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heros to sucessfully defeat the opposing team's champions. A team wins 
    by being the first to destroy the other team's "Nexus", a large structure located within their base. For more information check out <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank" style="color:aliceblue"> League of Legends Homepage </a> ! </p>

    <h3> Roles in League of Legends: </h3>

        <li> Top </li>
            <dd> The Bruiser / Tank is typically a top lane champion unless a lane swap has occurred.
                Although there are different types of top laners, generally speaking, teams will play with a ‘Tank’ champion - someone who can take a lot of damage before being eliminated. 
                They are used to get into the middle of the opposing team, being the focal point, or trying to stun or attack the enemy ADC.</dd>

        <li> Jungle </li>
        <dd> There are three lanes on the Summoner’s Rift (the LoL map) but five champions so the Jungler will spend most of their time between the lanes in the area of the map called the jungle.
             The primary reason for having a Jungler is to utilise the largest amount of the gold and experience points (XP) on the Summoner’s Rift at any one time.
             The Jungler will start and spend most of the early game inside the Jungle, and this allows him to build up his own economy of gold and XP that will eventually allow him to start ganking.
             This can typically be done within the first few minutes of a game or anywhere between 4 – 7 minutes in. 
             As well as ganking lanes, the Jungler is important for ensuring good vision around both the Dragon and the Baron  and helping support the Mid lane champion who can be pushed from both sides at all times.</dd>

        <li> Ability Power Carry </li>
        <dd> The Ability-Power Carry, also known as the APC. This role is used virtually always in the middle lane of the map.
             Along with the ADC, this is usually the champion that dishes out the highest amount of damage. The APC is usually ranged but can be either depending on what is picked. </dd>

        <li> Attack Damage Carry </li>
        <dd>The Attack-Damage Carry (ADC), now commonly known as the Marksman, is the main form of physical based damage hitting champion on your team.
             Typically, the ADC does a sizeable amount of damage to all on the enemy team, with the exception of potentially the Tank.
             The trade-off though, comes with an ADC’s relatively low base health and defence, meaning they are known to be “squishy” (die easily), but this is usually compensated by a Support champion. </dd>

        <li> Support </li>
        <dd>The Support player is coupled with the ADC and is mainly used to help the ADC in any way they can to get kills, protect their ADC with their abilities and provide vision for the ADC and the rest of the team by using wards or trinkets.
            Usually low on damage and high on hit points, they can be used as well to tank damage and distract the enemy onslaught (enabling the champions with higher damage to eliminate them).</dd>
